# Wellcome to Across the Universe

From 27th January 2016 until 16th March 2016, I spent my life in a classroom, every Monday and Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., in my purpose to learn all about JavaScript.

Few months later, I try to use what I learned in that clasrrom to do this. I have used NASA APIs because *"We are stardust"*. 

Probably my code could be better, but it is my first "project" in JavaScript so... Go easy, my friend!
